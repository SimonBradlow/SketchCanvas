# SketchCanvas

### by Simon Bradlow

This project is a simple sketchpad for making drawings!<br />
The project utilizes C++ and GLFW, an open-source OpenGL graphics framework<br />
***In order to run, you must first install GLFW [here](https://www.glfw.org/download)***

Starter code provided by UVM Professor [Lisa Dion](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs/profiles/lisa_dion), and adapted from the GLUT framework to GLFW with fellow classmate [@jespeland](https://github.com/jespeland)
